# Rock Paper Scissors Project
This is my first project in Javascript - a simple Rock Paper Scissors game played entirely in the console. You play five rounds against the computer. Whoever has the highest score after five rounds wins!

## Demonstrated Skills:

In this project, I showed off my problem solving skills by breaking up the project into many sub-problems, and tackling them one-by-one starting with the simplest one. 

I got to practice creating functions, making useful return values, working with random numbers, and understanding variable scope.

This is a game played entirely in the console, but in a future project in The Odin Project I will be returning to this and adding a GUI.
